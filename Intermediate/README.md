## Recursion

- Function calling itself until a condition is met.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
- Objects are used to model/describe real world or abstract features.
- In OPP, objects are self-contained block of codes.

### Principles

1. Abstraction

- Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
- Ignore/hide details or implementations that don't matter to interact

2. Encapsulation

- Reduce complexity + increase reusability
- Keeping some implementation private and others public

3. Inheritance

- Eliminate redundant code
- Allow to reuse common logic, methods or properties

4. Polymorphism

- Refactor code that is inherited.
- Instances can improve the logic inherited from a class

### OOP in JS

- In JS, we can accomplish OOP with:
  - ES6 classes, Factory Functions or Constructor Functions.
  - Prototypal inheritance.
  - All objects in JS delegate their behavior (prtotypes) to instances.
  - Methods and properties.
  - Getters and Setters.
